                            point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and
                            those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                            on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales
                            in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                            shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more.The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges
                            no tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship. </p>

                            in the center of Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one
                            of the largest plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>

                            population was 93,277.[1] The population density in that year was 1,794 people per square kilometer.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The modern city was named after the ancient Jewish town of Modi'in, which existed in the same area. Modi'in was the place of origin of the Maccabees, the Jewish rebels who freed Judea from the rule of the Selucid Empire and established
                            the Hasmonean dynasty, events commemorated by the holiday of Hanukkah. The modern city was built in the 20th century. A small part of the city (the Maccabim neighborhood) is not recognized by the European Union as being in
                            Israel, as it lies in what the 1949 Armistice Agreement with Jordan left as a no man's land, and was occupied in 1967 by Israel after it was captured from Jordan together with the West Bank proper.</p>
