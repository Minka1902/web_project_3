# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

by Michael Scharff

this project intreduses us to some cities around the world. you can read a little about each city and see a view of the city.
for each city there is a link to by the view (isn't functioning yet). i used the grid technique with the cities and the flex technique with every thing else.
